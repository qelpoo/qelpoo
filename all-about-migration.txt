gonna note here

################
# aria2c usage #
################
use aria2c to download with multiple protocols (such as HTTP(s), SFTP, FTP, BitTorent, Metalink)
example command:
### i usually use flag `-x` to speed up download bitrate and the maximum is 16 session ###
aria2c -x 5 --ftp-user=abc@example.com --ftp-passwd=gotchu ftp://example/backup.tar.gz <-- by ftp
aria2c -x 5 -i uris.txt <-- by url list
aria2c -x 3 http://example.com/pma.torent <-- download torent


note: 
	whenever the server had open port http/https and domain for ftp isn't live (it's mean domain die/expired)
		you can use username as directory (example: http://example.com/~username/filehere.tar.gz or ftp://example.com/~username/filehere.tar.gz)
	can continue download when download progress is failed by connection problem or user interupt (use `-o` flag, example aria2c https://example.com/example.tar.gz -o example.tar.gz)


##############
# axel usage #
##############
use axel to speed up download rate (better than aria2c for HTTP(s) method)
flag i used to:
	`-a` to show progress
	`-v` to see detail message (verbose)
	`-N` mean don't use any proxy to download the file
	`-k` to skip ssl verification (if needed)
	`-n` to multiply connection/session
	`-o` to resume file whenever the file wasn't completely downloaded (use it as same as previously on-progress file)
example command:
axel -avNk -n 10 https://example.com/~user1/user1.backup.tar.gz
axel -avN -n 5 http://example.com/file1.tar.gz


###############
# rsync usage #
###############
use rsync to boost your migrate (internal migration recomended)
flag i used to: 
	`-a` equal to -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X) // preserve time, owner, permissions, and group
	`-v --verbose` to showing information about rsync
	`-e` to custom port ssh or login by ssh key (by default port ssh 22)
	`--exclude='PATTERN' --exclude-from=FILE1` to exclude pattern or file you won't move to
	`-P` to show progress
	`-h` output numbers in a human-readable format
	`-z` to compress file data during data transfer to destination
example command:
rsync -avzh -e 'ssh -p 2022' /home/localmachine/filesource.tar.gz root@example.com:/home/exaple/public_html/
rsync -arP --exclude='.well-known' /home/example.com/public_html/ /home/subdomain.example.com/public_html/ <-- used this to migrate internal from folder a to b faster

# in case we needs to change ownership cpanel reseller account #

sample case ticket id: HOH-179-71761 in VP
username_a = example.com
username_b = example.id
	How it works
	Here:
	- Login to WHM Root >> Reseller Center >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges
	- Check username in ``reseller action for`` with domain ''example.com'' (equals to 'a') >> Find those username >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges (DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING)
	- In the tab ``Account Creation Limits`` >> Replicate package/feature from username 'a' to username 'b' >> In the username 'b', please make it sure it's same as username a then click "Save All Settings"
	- After all goods, then go to Resellers >> Change Ownership of Multiple Accounts (alternatively you can paste in searchbox WHM) >> search username 'b' (new reseller account with username) >> Click checkbox which from username 'a' >> all good
	- Check new username if there has example.com and example.id and DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING FROM OLD USERNAME
